# face-detection-and-capture

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

face detection software made using python 

 This Python script captures video from the webcam, detects faces, and identifies the person using a pre-trained deep learning model. It draws rectangles around recognized faces and displays the predicted name along with the confidence score.

Additional Libraries:

1. OpenCV (cv2): Used for webcam access, face detection, and image manipulation.
2. Keras: A high-level neural networks API that provides pre-trained models for image classification.
Feel free to explore this code and adapt it for your own projects! ðŸ˜Š
